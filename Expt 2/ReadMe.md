## Discord Analysis for Trends Identification In Communities 

### Discord
Discord is a popular communication platform that is primarily used by gamers and communities to chat and share media. It has both text and voice chat capabilities, and allows users to create and join different "servers" or groups, each with their own set of channels and topics. Users can also join and participate in different groups called "channels", which can be organized around specific topics or games.

Discord also allows users to share images, videos, and links, and it has a feature called "bots" which can be added to servers to perform various tasks, such as playing music or moderating chat. Additionally, Discord allows for the creation of "webhooks" which allow for the integration of other apps with Discord. It is widely used for gaming communities, but it also has a lot of use cases in different fields such as education, business, and social groups.

### Problem Statement 
A tool that provides a thorough and detail-oriented analysis of different sets of trends in various domains such as managing communities, most active time zones, different sets of topics, participation into particular events, most participants, most active region in the entire discord, etc. This is essential  for a social media managerÂ due to the complexity of tracking various channels and different trends and communities of people.
